# Chat_GPT_for_Discord

Hi! This is a ready-made bot for your discord server, which will use models that are publicly available from ```https://openai.com/```



For full - fledged work , you will need to create a file with the extension in the working folder .env and specify your values for DISCORD_TOKEN and OPEN_AI_TOKEN there



To create your own discord bot and get its API, you can use a web application from Discord developers ```https://discord.com/developers/applications/```
